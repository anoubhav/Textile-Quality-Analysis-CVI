# Textile-Quality-Analysis
This repository contains the documentation for the textile quality analysis project under the computer vision and intelligence club, IITM.
The aim of the project was to develop a mobile application that can quickly infer the quality metrics of a fabric (such as the thread count) instantaneously using the smartphone camera. This is a laborious, repetitive and time consuming task. Thus, we seeked to devise computer vision algorithms to tackle the same. This repository contains the documentation of the project. The link to the code and collected dataset are present in the documentation.
